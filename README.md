## Description
New World-Spawn-Alert is a powerful utility designed to enhance your gaming experience, especially for the popular game "New World." This tool allows you to set a timer after successfully defeating a specific enemy. Once you've vanquished your target, you can activate the timer by using the convenient shortcut Ctrl+W. With the Audio Alert feature, you'll never miss the timer's expiration. When the timer reaches its end, the tool will emit an audible sound, ensuring you're promptly notified.

New World-Spawn-Alert gives you the flexibility to choose whether you want the tool to automatically focus the "New World" game window after the timer ends. This optional focus feature ensures that you seamlessly return to the game, ready to take on the next challenge.
